# AI-Enhanced-Personal-Fitness-Trainer

### Project Overview
This project involves developing an AI-powered personal fitness trainer that uses simulation-based inference (SBI) to personalize workout plans and nutritional advice. The trainer will adapt to individual user profiles, fitness goals, and performance metrics, making real-time adjustments to optimize the user's fitness journey. This project combines AI, simulation-based inference, and user interaction to create a practical and engaging tool for fitness enthusiasts.

### Objectives
1. Develop a Fitness Simulation Model:
Create a simulator-based model that predicts fitness outcomes based on different exercise routines and nutritional plans.

2. Implement Simulation-Based Inference:
Use SBI techniques to infer and update the model based on user data, such as workout performance and body metrics.

3. Build a User Interface:
Develop an intuitive application where users can interact with the AI trainer, input their data, and receive personalized advice.

4. Optimize and Validate the Model:
Enhance the simulation model to handle real-world data variability and validate the recommendations with user feedback.

5. Deploy and Gather Feedback:
Deploy the application and collect user feedback to refine the fitness recommendations and improve the SBI techniques.
